# shiny-app-histograms

When I first started studying to become a data scientist, I wasn't very familiar with the shapes of some of the data distributions other than the normal distribution.

For this project I decided to create a shiny app that would allow a user to select a data distribution, 
and the app with then plot a histogram for random data with that distribution. 

The user sees the options as radio buttons and can decide to plot the following distributions:
- Normal
- Poisson
- Binomial
- Uniform
- Log-normal
- Exponential
- Geometric
- Logistic


There are 2 files as required to run a shiny app. One contains the user interface and the other one contains the
server code to take the input from the radio buttons and based on that, plot the right histrogram.

This app is deployed at https://anamecheverri.shinyapps.io/shiny-project
